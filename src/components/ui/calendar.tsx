/**
 * Calendar — a month of days, for picking one, several, or a range.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const [day, setDay] = useState<Date>();
 *
 * <Calendar mode="single" selected={day} onSelect={setDay} />
 * ```
 *
 * ## The grid is always six weeks
 *
 * A month needs five rows or six depending on what day it starts on. Drawing
 * only the rows a month uses makes the calendar change height as it is paged
 * through — everything below it jumps, and the days themselves appear to shift
 * between months. So the grid is six rows always, and the spare cells hold the
 * neighbouring months' days.
 *
 * ## How a range is drawn
 *
 * On the web the band under a selected range is one background with the ends
 * rounded by `:first-child` and `:last-child`. There are no pseudo-classes
 * here, so each cell draws its own piece of the band as a view *behind* the
 * number, and works out for itself where that piece has to stop.
 *
 * Two questions, and they are not the same one:
 *
 * - **How wide.** A day between the two ends fills its cell, so the pieces meet
 *   and the band reads as continuous. An end fills half its cell, from the
 *   centre outwards towards the middle of the range — the half that is not
 *   covered by the disc, so the disc appears to sit *on* the band rather than
 *   beside it. That is the join the old three-piece version never made, which
 *   is why a range used to read as two discs with a gap and a stripe.
 * - **Where it is rounded.** Only where it genuinely stops: at an end of the
 *   range, or at the edge of a row, because a range running over a weekend has
 *   to close off on Saturday and open again on Sunday rather than trailing into
 *   the gap between the two.
