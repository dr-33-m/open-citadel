/**
 * AIInput — the composer a person types a prompt into.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <AIInput value={value} onValueChange={setValue} onSubmit={send}>
 *   <AIInput.Field placeholder="Chat with the model" />
 *   <AIInput.Toolbar>
 *     <AIInput.Action label="Add" icon={<PlusIcon />} onPress={openSheet} />
 *     <AIInput.Pill label="Sonnet 4.6" detail="High" onPress={openModels} />
 *     <AIInput.Action label="Dictate" icon={<MicIcon />} onPress={record} />
 *     <AIInput.Submit />
 *   </AIInput.Toolbar>
 * </AIInput>
 * ```
 *
 * ## The field grows, and then it stops
 *
 * It opens one line tall and follows what is typed into it up to `maxRows`,
 * after which it holds that height and scrolls its own content. Five rows is
 * the default because a composer that keeps growing eventually pushes its own
 * send button off the bottom of the screen, and the row that carries the
 * actions stays pinned to the bottom of the box either way.
 *
 * ## It does not record anything
 *
 * There is a recording state, and it draws a live meter, but nothing here
 * touches the microphone. The app owns the recorder — the permission prompt,
 * the session, the platform quirks — and passes back a `level` between 0 and 1
 * along with a `status`. Pass a Reanimated shared value and a recorder
 * reporting every 30ms never re-renders anything above this component.
 *
 * That division is what keeps the composer free of an audio dependency.
 *
 * ## Glass is iOS 26 and above
 *
 * The surfaces ask for the system material and get it where it exists. Below
 * iOS 26, on Android, and for anyone with Reduce Transparency switched on,
 * they are drawn as solid token surfaces instead. Both are finished looks; see
 * `Glass` for why nothing is faked on the platforms without it.
 *
 * ## Where the props come from
 *
 * The root takes `ViewProps`. `Field` takes `TextInputProps`, so
 * `keyboardType`, `maxLength`, `autoFocus` and the rest work as they always
 * do. Every part takes `className`.
